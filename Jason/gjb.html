    <p class="jb">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,
         and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece
          of writing you do that is longer than a 
          few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
           This is because paragraphs show a reader where
            the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader
             see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

            Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. 
            A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long 
            illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character,
             or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more
              things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects.
               Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs
                share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is 
                a topic sentence.</p></pre>
