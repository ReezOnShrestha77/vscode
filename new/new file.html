<pre>In the song, Maui told Moana about his amazing deeds.
      Why - he pulled up the islands from the sea, he lifted the sky,
       he even found fire and gave it to humans!  



       As a demi-god, Maui was <b><i><u>born with special powers.
        Demi-god means one parent is a god and the other is human.
         Mauiâ€™s father</u> was the god and his</i></b> mother was human.
