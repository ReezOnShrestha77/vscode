    <p> <img src="o.jpg"/>  Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" within the Trimurti 
         the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. In Shaivism tradition,
          Shiva is one of the supreme beings who creates, protects and transforms 
          the universe .In the tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism, the Goddess,
           or Devi, is described as one of the supreme, yet Shiva is revered along
         with Vishnu and Brahma. A goddess is stated to be the energy and creative
        power (Shakti) of each, with Parvati (Sati) the equal complementary partner 
        of Shiva.[14][15] He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja 
        of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism. </p>
