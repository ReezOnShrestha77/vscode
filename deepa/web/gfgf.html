  Shiva is one of the supreme beings who creates, protects and transforms 
  the universe .In the tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism, the Goddess,
   or Devi, is described as one of the supreme, yet Shiva is revered along
 with Vishnu and Brahma. A goddess is stated to be the energy and creative
power (Shakti) of each, with Parvati (Sati) the equal complementary partner 
of Shiva.[14][15] He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja
